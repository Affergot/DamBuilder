## DamBuilder

# Introduction
This project is in association with the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Our team was tasked to create an interactive game that people could stop by and play while on a tour of the USACE's Dam facility. The goals were to start a foundation for the project and turn it from an idea into a guideline for future students to follow and build from.
